This project is a step-by-step guide to deploying a simple app using minikube.

To get started, follow these instructions:

1. Start a minikube cluster by running the following command:
    ```
    minikube start
    ```

2. Access the Kubernetes dashboard running within the minikube cluster:
    ```
    minikube dashboard
    ```

3. Build image using this command: 
    ```
    docker build -t my-local-image:1.0 .
    ```

3. Once the cluster is up and running, you can interact with it using kubectl, just like any other Kubernetes cluster. For example, you can start a server by running:
    ```
    kubectl create deployment test-minikube --image=my-local-image:1.0 
    ```

4. Expose the deployment as a NodePort service:
    ```
    kubectl expose deployment test-minikube --type=NodePort --port=3000
    ```

5. To open the exposed endpoint in your browser, use the following command:
    ```
    minikube service test-minikube
    ```

That's it! You have successfully deployed a simple app using minikube.

In case minikube is not able to read local images, run following commands to make it work - 
    ```
    minikube docker-env
    eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)
    docker images
    ```


Note - Here deployment.yaml and service.yaml are not getting used. We can use following commands to trigger same things with given config ->

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
